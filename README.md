# Flight Booking System

## The airport ticket booking system books flights to Calgary, Montr√©al, Toronto and Vancouver


- **What will the application do?**  
The application will be used in a small airport where tickets can only be booked at the airport terminal using booking 
machines. The airport operates flights only to Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver and Calgary. The application takes in 
required information about the travel and presents the customer with options to choose from. Upon selection the customer
is asked to enter their personal information. When all the information is entered booking is confirmed, and a booking 
number is generated.

- **Who will use it?**  
The system is to be installed outside airports for the *customers* to conveniently book tickets on the 
spot using electronic payment methods.

- **Why is this project of interest to you?**  
The project is of my interest because I am interested in booking systems and 
how companies like travel companies help book tickets to their customers so conveniently.



## **User Stories**

- As a user, I want to be able to select my travel date.
- As a user, I want to be able to select my travel destination from options given.
- As a user, I want to be able to select my flights from a list of available flights.
- As a user, I want to be able to enter my personal details such as Name, date of birth, Phone number.
- As a user, I want to be able to select my seat on a flight from a list of available seats on the flight.
- As a user, I want to be able to save my booked ticket data even when the system is shut down and be able to 
 retrieve past bookings.

## Limitation for this Project
- All the flights to all the selected destinations are only available on 3rd, 15th and 24th of the current month.

## Phase 4: Task 2
- I have gone with the first option provided on edX. The details are given below in the next point.
- Identify the class and method that has a robust design - the class that is made robust is the Booking class in the
 model package. The method generateBookingNo() throws checked exceptions, and the tests have been added to the 
 BookingTest class.
 
## Phase 4: Task 3
- The UML class diagram represents all the relations between the classes in my project. The dotted lines represent weak
 relationships whereas the interfaces are represented with an "I" in the box, and the classes are represented with "C"
 on the box.
- If I had more time I would have implemented bi-directional relationships and would have tried to introduce type 
hierarchy in my project that was taught after I was done with phase 1. I would have tested this program more rigorously 
to remove every possible bug that I haven't caught
 yet.
- If I had more time, I would have tried to make my GUI a little more pleasing to the eye by adding graphics.
